# Start your Day 

``` prompt 
Create me a well organized and formatted overview to start my day and be my assistant. Make it visually appealing with section headers and spacing between each section so I can read it easily and use plenty of emojis to give it personality. 

Tell me the weather forecast in Fahrenheit in my location today and the next three days. 

Tell me about any major breaking news on a national or local level that I need to be aware of before I start my day. 

Tell me about upcoming national holidays in the US. List all events on my calendar for today. 

Summarize calendar items from the previous business day so I know who to follow up with. Remind me if there are any important calendar events for next week that I need to prepare for. Tell me about unread emails, teams messages, and teams posts from my manager or any senior leaders. 

Separately, tell me about unread emails, teams messages, and teams posts from other people reporting to my manager or people i regularly work with. Highlight any emails that appear important, urgent, or have recent due dates. Include any action items I need to complete or follow up on that were mentioned in Teams Chats, Meetings, or Email. 

Give me the latest news and stock price for the company I work for. Also tell me news specifically about products I regular work with and other competing products. 

Give me a joke of the day that is coworker friendly, words of inspiration to tell my team, and what happened on this day in history.
