# Hero's Journey vs. Plato's Cave

A prompt for philosophers. Compares and contrasts the *Myth of the Hero's Journey* and allegory of *Plato's Cave*.

## Hero's Journey

The *Hero's Journey* is a narrative structure where a protagonist embarks on an adventure, faces and overcomes trials, achieves a significant victory, and returns home transformed, often bringing newfound wisdom or a boon to their community.

## Plato's Cave

Plato's *Allegory of the Cave* is a philosophical metaphor illustrating the journey from ignorance to enlightenment, where prisoners in a cave mistake shadows for reality until one escapes, discovers the true world, and returns to enlighten others.

# The Prompt

Get started with the following prompt:

``` prompt
I am trying to spot patterns in philosophical ideas. Compare and contrast the Myth of the Hero's Journey with Plato's Cave.
```

Frame the information in a pop-culture context to get an "a-ha" moment:

``` prompt
List me movies that follow either narrative device. Format as a table, with Movie Name, Narrative, and Year Released as columns
```

Now we're just showing off: 

``` prompt
Can you add a column for director and a column with a link to the movie on imdb.com??
```
