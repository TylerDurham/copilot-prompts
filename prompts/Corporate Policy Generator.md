Generate me a sensible policy for [Creating, Modifying, and Governing Policies]

Here are my configuration parameters for the outputs for each section.

- Purpose: Transparency
- Summary: Expand on purpose with a paragraph or two.
- Requirements: The bulk of the content. Should not feel like boilerplate language.
- Exceptions: Exceptions require VP Approval
- Enforcement: Severe
- Vice Presidents: Buddy Durham (admin@contoso.com), Corey Grant (CoreyG@contoso.com)

Use the configuration variables above to generate sections on Purpose, Summary, Requirements, Exceptions, Enforcement

For the [Requirements] section, use the following topics as subsections:

- Corporate Policy Committee
- Executive Leaders and Policy Owners
- Format of Corporate Policy & Procedure
- Variations to Corporate Policy & Procedure
  
Use a formal, legal, no-nonsense tone.

Now, generate the content!
