Generate me a sensible policy for [Creating, Modifying, and Governing Policies]

Here are my configuration parameters for the outputs for each section.

- Purpose: Transparency
- Summary: Expand on purpose with a paragraph or two.

Use the configuration variables above to generate sections on Purpose, Summary, Requirements, Exceptions, Enforcement

For the [Requirements] section, use the following topics as subsections:

- Corporate Policy Commitee
