# Earnings Statement


``` prompt
Goal:

- Analyze profitability trends across business segments.

Context:

- The spreadsheet contains earnings data for both traditional and cloud-based business units. I want to understand how profitability has evolved over time, and how the performance of newer cloud businesses compares to traditional operations.

Source:

I will upload a file containing the relevant spreadsheet(s).

Expectations:

Begin with a summary report that highlights:
- Key profitability trends
- Segment comparisons (traditional vs. cloud)
- Major anomalies or shifts

Follow with a detailed breakdown including:

- Profitability by segment over time
- Cost structure and breakdown
- Notable anomalies or outliers

Strong emphasis on visualizations:

Include charts, graphs, or tables wherever possible to illustrate trends, comparisons, and anomalies
Prefer time-series visuals for trend analysis and bar/pie charts for cost and segment breakdowns
```
